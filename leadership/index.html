  <p>The construction process begins with the generation of a written solicitation from a group of women, a mayor, or a village leader who have heard about the stove and the program.  Our solicitations require that each Señora interested in obtaining a stove provide her name and government identification number. </p>

  <p>A member of Proyecto Mirador or one of its Ejecutores that will have responsibility for the team that will construct stoves in the area, and the municipality together organize a community meeting to explain to all interested participants the benefits of the stove, the materials each beneificiary must provide, and to set a date for construction of the village.  After the meeting, the list of beneficiaries is solidified, and a house by house plan for implementation is developed.  Proyecto Mirador sources the construction materials and the Ejecutor responsible for the village delivers them to the job site and assigns the stove builders on his/her team the homes that will be built each day. </p>

    Proyecto Mirador currently supports 15 full time businesses including 6 new Ejecutor construction companies and 9 companies that supply the materials.

  <p>Professor Elder oversees manufacturing of the plancha and chimney, helps improve stove design, manages receipt of solicitations and delegation to the Ejecutores, and develops the build out schedule by village. He manages follow up visits to beneficiaries by PM Supervisors who use technology to monitor the condition of the stove and insure proper understanding of the necessary maintenance steps.</p>
